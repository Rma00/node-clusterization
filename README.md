Node.js Cluster Node.js is single-threaded by design, running on the event loop, which can limit its ability to fully utilize multi-core processors. To address this, the Node.js Cluster module allows applications to fork multiple processes, called worker processes, that can run simultaneously, each handling separate tasks or requests.
